        'I went to atleast 7 different websites to sell my 07 gold and I did not feel comfortable with selling my gold to any of them. At this website, Josh the customer service guy made me feel extremely comfortable and even took his time to let me fix things on my end without hanging up. I recommend this site beyond belief. Great people and they speak english. Josh is the best and I am so grateful for having him as my customer service agent. This is the website I will use from now on to sell my GP!'
